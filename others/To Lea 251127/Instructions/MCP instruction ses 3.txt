PRACTICE 3

The procedure remains the same. However, you will feel that the task becomes more difficult because the cues and letters are shown only briefly in some of the trials.

__________

Remember to keep fixating the red point in the center. In case you make an eye movement, you will not be able to earn money for the reported letter.
