PRACTICE 1

In the following, you will see a red point in the center of the display. Please always fixate this point. 

Upon pressing *space*, four squares will appear in the center of the display. In one of these squares, you will see a digit from 1 to 4. This is a cue indicating one of four locations indicated by green dots within circles at the corners of the display.

Red lines between the squares and the green dots show the relations.
__________

Your task is to look as quickly as possible at one of the dots. Please turn to the experimenter who will explain the location rules of the cues and dots to you.
__________

You will earn points for looking at the green dots. The number of points you can earn is dependent on the associated cue. The digit 1 allows you to earn 1 point, and so on until a maximum reward of 4 points per trial. 

Your collected points will be translated into a monetary reward that is added to your compensation payment. After each trial, you will see how many points you have earned in that trial relative to what you could have earned, along with the amount of money in DKK that you have obtained. 
You will also see the speed of your eye movement to the dot. Please, try to be as fast as possible while still earning as many points as possible.
__________

Remember to fixate the red point in the center at the start of the trial. If you fail to fixate at the start, you will still receive feedback on your performance. However, the collected points will not be added to your final monetary reward.  

Press *space* to begin.
